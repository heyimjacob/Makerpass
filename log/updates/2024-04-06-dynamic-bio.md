# Dynamic Bio Website Implementation Plan - 2024-04-06

## Initial Setup

### Architecture Overview
- Create a simple web application that displays a dynamically-generated bio based on content scraped from links
- Implement a CLI tool for adding new links
- Automatically regenerate bio when new content is added

### Core Components
1. **Link Storage**
   - JSON-based storage for link metadata and scraped content
   - Fields: URL, title, date added, content summary, scrape date

2. **Content Scraper**
   - Firecrawl integration for extracting content from URLs
   - Support for different content types (articles, profiles, projects)
   - Content cleaning and preprocessing

3. **Bio Generator**
   - OpenAI API integration for generating coherent bio text
   - Prompt engineering for consistent style and tone
   - Caching to minimize API costs

4. **Command Line Interface**
   - Simple CLI tool for adding/removing links
   - Options for immediate or scheduled bio regeneration

5. **Web Frontend**
   - Minimal, fast-loading design
   - Display bio and list of links
   - Basic styling with responsive design

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up project directory structure

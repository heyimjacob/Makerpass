1. **Repository Structure**
   - Created a clean, organized directory structure
   - Set up proper error handling and logging
   - Added appropriate documentation

2. **Core Functionality**
   - Implemented a mock scraper for content extraction during development
   - Set up OpenAI integration for bio generation
   - Created JSON storage for links and generated bios
   - Built a command-line interface for managing links and generating bios

3. **Web Interface**
   - Developed a clean, responsive web UI using Express and EJS
   - Implemented routes for viewing and managing content
   - Added CSS styling for a professional appearance

4. **Deployment**
   - Containerized the application with Docker
   - Created a comprehensive deployment guide
   - Set up Nginx as a reverse proxy
   - Configured proper environment variable handling

## Next Steps

1. **Authentication**
   - Implement user authentication for personalized bios
   
2. **Enhanced Scraping**
   - Replace the mock scraper with actual Firecrawl integration

   - Implement bio versioning and history

4. **Analytics**
   - Add tracking for bio views and link clicks

## Technical Notes

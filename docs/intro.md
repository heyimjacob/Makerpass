# Welcome to the ItWasJacob Platform

## What Is This?

The ItWasJacob platform is your digital home on the internet. Think of it like a dynamic, living business card that evolves as you create content across the web. Unlike traditional websites that stay static until manually updated, this platform:

1. Automatically updates your bio based on content you publish elsewhere
2. Creates a central hub that showcases your digital footprint
3. Evolves its understanding of you the more you use it

## For Marketers Learning to Code

If you're a marketer venturing into product development or learning to code, this project offers an excellent learning opportunity:

- **Practical Application**: You'll see how code connects to real marketing objectives (building your personal brand)
- **Modern Stack**: The project uses current technologies without overwhelming complexity
- **Quick Results**: You can see tangible outcomes quickly, rather than getting lost in theory

## Core Concept

The magic happens through a simple loop:

1. You add a link to content you've created (article, profile, project)
2. The system automatically scrapes that content
3. An AI rewrites your bio based on all your content
4. Your website instantly reflects this updated bio

This means your personal brand evolves organically as you create content elsewhere. The more you publish, the more your bio reflects your expertise and interests.

## Key Components

As a marketer, you should understand these major pieces:

1. **Web Scraper**: Extracts meaningful content from links you add
2. **Storage System**: Keeps track of your links and bio versions 
3. **AI Bio Generator**: Creates coherent narratives from your scattered content
4. **Web Interface**: Displays your bio and links to visitors
5. **Command-Line Tool**: Lets you easily add new content

## Getting Started

The most important commands to know:

```bash
# Add a new link to your collection
npm run add-link -- --url https://example.com --regenerate

# View your current bio
npm run show-bio

# List all your collected links

```
